Approximate Nearest Neighbors with Locality-sensitive Hashing 
======

Often data is too large to apply k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN). It makes sense to find approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) instead. Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is a powerful and popular algorithm to do that.

These materials walk through how the LSH algorithm works and common industry use cases.
